# PAGES

## index

the app's landing page. Just a log in form.
User accounts are in the static/users/users.json folder as there's no backend.

## contacts

list of all user's contacts.
Currently the contacts disappear on page refresh as I'm not [persisting state to local storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuex-persist#tips-for-nuxt).
But this would be an ideal situation.
